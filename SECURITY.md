We take the security of this project seriously. If you find any security vulnerabilities, please report them.

### How to Report

2.  **Public Issues**: For non-sensitive issues or general security hardening suggestions, you may open a GitHub issue.
3.  **Response**: We will try to get back to you within 48 hours.

### Scope

- **In Scope**: Application logic, installer integrity, data handling.
- **Out of Scope**: Third-party dependencies (unless the vulnerability is caused by our usage), user environment security.
